1.What is the lambda expression of Java 8?
-->A lambda expression in Java 8 is a concise way to represent an anonymous function, enabling functional programming by treating functionality as a method argument.

2.Can you pass lambda expressions to a method? When?
-->Yes, you can pass lambda expressions to a method when the method parameter is a functional interface.

3.What is the functional interface in Java 8?
-->A functional interface in Java 8 is an interface with exactly one abstract method, used as the target for lambda expressions and method references.

4.Why do we use lambda expression in Java?
-->Lambda expressions are used to simplify the code, enhance readability, and enable functional programming by allowing the passing of behavior as a parameter.

5.Is it mandatory for a lambda expression to have parameters?
-->No, it is not mandatory for a lambda expression to have parameters; it can have zero or more parameters depending on the target functional interface.
