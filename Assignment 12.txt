1) What is the default value of Array for different data Types?

-> 0 is the default value of the Array for different data Types.

2)Can your pass the negative number in Array size?

->NO, We cannot pass the negative number in Array size as the dimensions cannot have a negative size.

3)Where does Array stored in JVM memory?

->Array is Stored in Heap Memory.

4)What are the disadvantages of Array?

-> 1]Array once created then the sizecannot be Increased or decreased.

   2]Array Stores only homogeneous data element.
   
5)What is an Anonymous Array in Java? Give an Example?

-> 1]An anonymous array is an array that is created without explicitly specifying its name. 
   2]It is typically used for short-lived purposes and doesn't have a reference variable.
   3]Anonymous arrays are declared and instantiated at the same time.
   
   Example:-
		public class AnonymousArrayExample
		{
			public static void main(String[] args)
	        {
				printElements("Numbers", 1, 2, 3, 4, 5);
				printElements("Characters", 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e');
			}

			static void printElements(String label, Object... elements) 
			{
				System.out.print(label + ": ");
				for (Object element : elements)
				{
				System.out.print(element + " ");
				}
			System.out.println();
			}
		}

6) What are the different ways to traverse an Array in Java?

->1] For Loop:

     int[] numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
     for (int i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) 
	 {
       System.out.print(numbers[i] + " ");
     }
	 
  2]Enhanced For Loop:
  
	int[] numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
		for (int num : numbers) 
		{
			System.out.print(num + " ");
		}

  3]While Loop:
		
	int[] numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
	int i = 0;
	while (i < numbers.length)
	{
    System.out.print(numbers[i] + " ");
    i++;
	}
	
  4]Using Arrays.toString()Method:
  
	int[] numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
    System.out.println(Arrays.toString(numbers));
	
7)What is the difference between length and length()method Give an Example?

->1] length:
			It is a property of arrays used to find the number of elements in the array.
			numbers.length is used for array.
			
			Example:
				int[] numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
				int arrayLength = numbers.length; // Property of arrays
				System.out.println("Array Length: " + arrayLength);

  2] length():
			It is a method of the string class used to find the number of characters in a string.
			text.length() is used for string.
			
			Example:
				String text = "Hello, World!";
				int stringLength = text.length(); // Method of the String class
				System.out.println("String Length: " + stringLength);
