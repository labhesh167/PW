1)What is statically typed and Dynamically typed Programming Language?
-->A statically typed programming language is one in which variable types are checked at compile-time. This means that each variable must be declared with a specific data type, and the compiler enforces type checking to ensure that the operations performed on variables are valid according to their declared types. If there is a type mismatch, such as assigning a value of one type to a variable of another type, the compiler will generate an error.

2)What s Variable in Java?
--> Variable is a container which holds the value while the Java program is executed. A variable is assigned with a data type. Variable is a name of memory location.

3)How to Assign a Value To Variable?
--> We can assign a value to a variable by using '=' sign

4)What are Primitive Data types in Java?
-->The primitive data types include boolean,char,byte,short,int,long,float,and double.

5)what are the identifiers in Java?
-->Identifiers are names which we give to a class, interface,package,method.All identifier names should be different.

6)List the Operators in java?
-->There are 6 types of operators in java
	1.Arithmetic Operators
	2.Relational Operators
	3.Logical Operators
	4.Assignment operators
	5.Unary Operators
	6.Bitwise operators

7)Explain about Increment and Decrement operators and give an examples.
-->The increment operator increases the value of the variable by one and the decrement operator decreases the value of the variable by one.
	eg.X = ++A;  
	   X = A++;
