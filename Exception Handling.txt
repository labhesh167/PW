1. Explain different types of Errors in java.
-->
	In any programming language we categorize error into 2 types
		1.Syntax Error/CompileTime Mistakes
		2.Logical Error/RunTimeMistakes
		
	Syntax error/CompileTime Mistakes
		It refers to the mistakes done by the programmer with respect to syntax.
		These mistakes are identified by the compiler, do we say it as“CompileTimeMistake”.
	
	Logical Error/RunTimeMistakes
		It refers to the mistakes done by the programmer in terms of writing a logic
		These mistakes are identified by jvm during the execution of a program, do se say it as “RunTimeMistakes”.

2. What is an Exception in Java.
-->An unwanted ?expected event that disturbs the normal flow of excecution of a program is called "Exception handling".
			i)The main objective of Exception handling is to handle the exception.
			ii)It is available for graceful termination of program.
	
3.How can you handle exception in java ? Explain with an example.
-->Exception can be performed using:
		Try: The set of statements or code which requires monitoring for an exception is kept under this block.
		
		Catch: This block catches all exception that were trapped in the try block.
		
		Finally: This block is always performed irrespective of the catching of exceptions in the try or catch block.
	
	Code:
		class Launch
		{
			public static void main(String args[])
			{
			try
			{
				System.out.print("Hello"+" " + 1 / 0);
			}
			catch(ArithmeticException e)
			{
				System.out.print("World);
			}
			}
		}
	
4.Why do we need exception handling in Java.
-->If there is no try and catch block while an exception occurs, the program will terminate. Exception handling
	ensures the smooth running of a program without program termination.

5.What is the difference between exception and error in Java?
-->Errors typically happen while an application is running. For instance, Out of Memory Error occurs in case
	the JVM runs out of memory On the other hand, exceptions are mainly caused by the application For instance,
	Null Pointer Exception happens when an app tried to get through a null object.
	
6. Name the ddifferent types of exception in java.
-->Based on handling by JVM, there are typically two types of exceptions in java:
	
	i)Checked: Occurs during the compilation, Here, the compiler checks whether the exception is handled and throws an error accordingly.
	
	ii)Unchecked: Occur during program execution. These are not detectable during the compilation process.
	
7.Can we just use try instead of finally and catch block? Give an Example.
-->No,doing so will show a compilation error. Catch or finally block must always accompany try block.We can remove either finally block or catch block,nut never both.
